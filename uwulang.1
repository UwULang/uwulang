The interpreter is a command-line program that reads a UwULang script from a file or from standard input and executes it. The interpreter should be able to be invoked with the command \fBuwulang\fR. with no arguments provided

That will launch you into an interactive interpreter. The interpreter should print a prompt starting with >, and then read a line of input from standard input. The interpreter should then execute the line of input as a UwULang program. The interpreter should then print the prompt again and read another line of input. This process should continue until the user does Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Z. The interpreter should then exit.
